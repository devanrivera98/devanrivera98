My name is Devan Rivera, and I am a web developer with a passion for crafting immersive experiences through elegant and functional designs. I possess strong skills in JavaScript, React.js, CSS, HTML, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, allowing me to create dynamic, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications. When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking, watching basketball, or enjoying quality time with my pets.
